how do i incorporate the spark, pyspark, postgres, mongodb into the same docker container

# def open_test_images():
#     test_images = imread(r"data/Test/Apple/AB3_100.jpg")
#     # show_img(image)
#     red, yellow =   test_images.copy(), test_images.copy()
#     red[:,:,(1,2)] = 0
#     yellow[:,:,2]=0
#     # show_images(images=[red,yellow], titles=['Red Intensity','Yellow Intensity'])
#     # gray_image = rgb2gray(test_images) #for making image gray scale
#     # show_images(images=[image,gray_image],titles=["Color","Grayscale"])
#     return test_images
